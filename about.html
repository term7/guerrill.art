    Best practices <a href="#best_practices"></a>
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    The list below is a collection of behaviour that we expect to see from our users. If you see a user go against these best practices in a way that bothers you, please file a report and we will talk to them. While these best practices are designed to be guidelines for a good communal instance, repeated malicious unwillingness to follow the best practices will be considered just like breaking a rule.
  </p>
  <ol class="rules-list">
    <li>
      <span class="rules-list__text indent">
        In general, use the tools provided to foster a considerate and accessible atmosphere. This includes the liberal use of content warnings (especially on potentially disturbing or controversial topics), and alt-text captioning of media files.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="rules-list__text indent">
        When possible, provide credit for creative works in your posts that are not your own.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="rules-list__text indent">
        Uninvited comments about another user's personal choices, lifestyle or family are strongly discouraged and may be considered harassment. Inappropriate sexual attention, comments about appearance and implication of physical contact will not be tolerated toward any non-consenting user.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="rules-list__text indent">
        If you post sexual content or gore, use content warnings.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="rules-list__text indent">
        If you post advertisements, use a content warning. Advertisements should not be excessive or automated.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="rules-list__text indent">
        Bots may only interact with a user when they're invited by that user to do so.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="rules-list__text indent">
        Automated posts and high-frequency posts should be unlisted (rendering visible to everybody, but not appearing on the local timeline) to keep the local timeline of our instance a place of community dialogue and human interaction. This extends to bots, feed posters, Twitter "retweets" and Twitter crossposts with broken mentions. Crossposter accounts that stop being active participants in our community may be removed at the discretion of the moderators.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="rules-list__text indent">
        In discussions, please remain civil, do not insult the people you're talking to. Note that irony, sarcasm, or similar modes of language don't translate well to written language and tend to escalate discussions or misunderstandings.
